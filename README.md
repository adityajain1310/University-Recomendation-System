# University-Recomendation-System
We have scrap data from edulix to make a university recomendation system. For an aspiring graduate student, choosing which universities to apply to is a conundrum. Often, the students wonder if their profile is good enough for a certain university. We addressed this issue by building a recommendation system based on various classification algorithms. Since data was not readily available, we scraped data Edulix.com, and a dataset containing profiles of students with admits/rejects
